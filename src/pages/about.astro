						As you may have gathered by now, my name is Alex Abushady; I am currently working as a Software Engineer for MSI. During my time at MSI, I've witnessed the company grow from a small team of just three developers (including myself) into a much larger organization with over 30 developers across multiple teams. As you might imagine, over that time, I've learned how to navigate both a small start-up environment and a larger, more structured environment that comes with being in a more seasoned, publicly traded company.

						In recent times, I've taken a shine to LLMs, not only for the utility that can come from having a sounding board and quick way to iterate on ideas, but also for having a customizable, personalized assistant that can be used for leisure just as much as it can be used for work. My passion is to create a model that can handle a wide range of tasks for work, while still being friendly, social, and, most importantly, fun to interact with. Because if not, then what was the point of it all?

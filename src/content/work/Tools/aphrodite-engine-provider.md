A [fork](https://github.com/Llama-in-C/ai) of the popular Vercel AI provider, this project allows for developers to integrate the AI chatbots ran locally and powered by [aphrodite-engine](https://github.com/aphrodite-engine/aphrodite-engine). For this project I've also created an [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aphrodite-engine-provider/v/0.1.0?activeTab=readme)!

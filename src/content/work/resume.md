Over the past 5+ years, I've been building production systems for enterprise environments, with experience ranging from API development handling 50M+ annual requests to architectural redesigns that significantly improve system performance. My work has involved everything from individual contributor roles developing customer-facing applications to technical leadership positions managing engineering teams and complex system migrations.

The systems I've worked on span billing platforms, insurance workflows, and customer management tools - all requiring high availability and fault tolerance. I've found that some of the most impactful work comes from optimizing existing systems rather than building from scratch. For instance, rearchitecting legacy flows using modern patterns can reduce code redundancy by 50% while significantly improving development velocity.

Beyond individual development, I've had the opportunity to lead technical initiatives, mentor other engineers, and establish development patterns that get adopted as team standards. I'm particularly interested in how local AI/LLM integration can enhance traditional business applications, which has led to several personal projects exploring these integrations.

Currently working at MSI building insurance technology platforms. The full details of my experience and technical background are available in my [resume](/assets/AlexanderAbushady2025ResumeRefreshConsolidated.pdf).

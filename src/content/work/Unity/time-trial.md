The first phase of an [ambitious combat racing project](https://github.com/AAbushady/Time-Trial) inspired by IGPX and Twisted Metal. This time-trial prototype establishes the high-speed racing foundation before adding transformation mechanics and vehicle combat.

## The Vision
Building toward a game where high-speed racing meets mech combat. Think Twisted Metal's vehicular mayhem combined with transformation mechanics, and mech combat of IGPX. But first, I need to nail the fundamentals.

### Current Phase: Racing Foundation
Starting with a pure racing prototype to get the speed and movement right:
- Arcade-style vehicle controller tuned for aggressive, momentum-based racing
- High-speed physics that will translate to both vehicle and mech modes
- Control responsiveness that can handle the chaos of combat at 200mph+

### What's Coming
- **Phase 2**: Weapon systems and combat mechanics
- **Phase 3**: Transformation system between vehicle and mech modes
- **Phase 4**: Enemy AI Combatants/Racers

Building in phases lets me validate each system before adding complexity. The racing has to feel perfect before adding a second mode and combat on top.

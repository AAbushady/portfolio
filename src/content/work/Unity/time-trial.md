The first phase of an [ambitious combat racing project](https://github.com/AAbushady/Time-Trial) inspired by IGPX and Twisted Metal. This time-trial prototype establishes the high-speed racing foundation before adding transformation mechanics and vehicle combat.

Building toward a game where high-speed racing meets mech combat. Think Twisted Metal's vehicular mayhem combined with transformation mechanics, and mech combat of IGPX. But first, I need to nail the fundamentals.

Starting with a pure racing prototype to get the speed and movement right:
- Arcade-style vehicle controller tuned for aggressive, momentum-based racing
- High-speed physics that will translate to both vehicle and mech modes
- Control responsiveness that can handle the chaos of combat at 200mph+

Future additions will include:
- Weapon systems and combat mechanics
  - Weapons need to work differently in car and mech mode...
  - Attacking other racers can cause debris making the track more perilous
    - This would encourage players in the lead to engage with runner up racers allowing for more opportunities for lower positioned players to overtake.
- Transformation system between vehicle and mech modes
  - Car mode is all about speed and maintaining/catching lead.
  - Mech mode is for combat and creating chaos for other racers.
- Enemy AI Combatants/Racers
  - Diverse cast of interesting characters to choose from.
  - Racers will feel unique and have interesting back-stories.

Building in phases lets me validate each system before adding complexity. The racing has to feel perfect before adding a second mode and combat on top.
